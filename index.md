## Featured Projects: 
1. #### Canterbury Financials
   This is a BI report for reporting on some financial data provided for analysis. This helps the team have a visual representation of their financial statements requested at the Executive meeting.
   
   Tools used were Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

   The report is an executive summary and emphasis placed on the liquidity part of the financial statements.
