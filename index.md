1. ### Canterbury Financials
   This is a BI report for reporting on some financial data provided for analysis. This helps the team have a visual representation of their financial statements requested at the Executive meeting.
   
   Tools used were Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

   The report is in two parts: summary and dashboard with easy navigation.
